How to quickly host a web projectHow to quickly host a web¬†project
Let‚Äôs say you took some time over the weekend to study and ended up creating a cool project, which you then stored on your GitHub. But you realized the project is so great that you want to share it with the world.


What to do? üòÖ


Well, in this article I‚Äôll show you how to quickly  host a web project with your own personal domain.


### A bit of¬†history


Before we begin, let‚Äôs understand a little about how website hosting works.


When you create a website, it consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. For these files to be accessible to anyone, they need to be stored on a server.


A server is a computer that stays on 24/7 and has the function of storing and making your website files available to those who access them.


There are several companies that offer this hosting service, and most of them charge a monthly fee to keep your site online.


However, there is a way to host a site for free, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to cover in this article.


### Hosting a web project for¬†free


In the past, back in the 2000s, to host a website you needed a physical server, which stayed on all the time and had a fast internet connection.


Or you used one of the few free hosting services that existed at the time, which were usually very limited and full of ads. For example, Geocities.


Nowadays, it‚Äôs much simpler. There are several companies that offer free website hosting, with much more advanced features and no ads.


Here, we are talking about companies like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Surge, GitHub Pages, among others.


In this article, we will see how to host a web project using Vercel.
