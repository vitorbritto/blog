How to update data using Polling and Webhooks
How to update data using Polling and Webhooks


In the realm of APIs, two primary methods exist for obtaining updates from a data source: Polling and Webhooks.





𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 employs a pull-based approach, where the client periodically requests data from the server. This can occur at regular intervals or be triggered by specific events.


𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 use a push-based approach, where the server notifies the client when new data is available. This proves more efficient than polling, as clients only receive notifications when new information arises.


Choosing between the two methods hinges on your precise requirements.


𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 is advisable if:


• You require updates from infrequently updated data sources.• Budget constraints exist, as polling is simpler and more cost-effective than webhooks.• You desire greater control over update reception timing.


𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 are suitable if:


• You need updates from frequently updated data sources.• Immediate notification upon new data availability is crucial.• Reducing API requests is a priority.• System decoupling and scalability are objectives.


In general, webhooks are a more efficient and scalable solution, albeit potentially more complex to set up and manage. If uncertain, consulting an API expert is wise.
