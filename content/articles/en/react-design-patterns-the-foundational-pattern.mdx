title: React Design Patterns: The Foundational Pattern
excerpt: Understanding the pattern and use cases
---

Foundational pattern refers to a way of organizing information, knowledge, or ideas into a basic structure or frame. It is used in various fields such as computer science, architecture, design, and education, among others.

A foundational pattern acts as a template that can be reused or adapted to suit various situations or contexts. It typically consists of essential elements or components that are necessary for understanding or solving a particular problem or challenge. The use of foundational patterns can facilitate communication, collaboration, and innovation among different individuals or groups working on related tasks or projects.

## How it helps inÂ React?

This pattern helps to simplify the code and make it more modular and reusable. Additionally, the use of virtual DOM allows for efficient updates and rendering of the UI.

A Foundational Pattern in React can be implemented in code by creating a base component that all other components inherit from. This base component can include common functionality, such as state management or lifecycle methods, that all components need. This approach promotes code reuse and helps to keep the application organized.

## Case of Use

Suppose you are building a large-scale application with many different types of components. Each of these components needs to handle errors in a consistent way, such as displaying an error message to the user and logging the error to the console. Rather than duplicating this error handling code in each component, you can create a base component that handles errors and have your other components inherit from it. This promotes code reuse and helps to keep your application organized.

Here is an example implementation of a simple base component:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorComponent extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = {      // initial state    };  }  componentDidMount() {    // component mounted  }  render() {    return (      // base component JSX    );  }}export default ErrorComponent;
```

This `ErrorComponent` can now be used as a starting point for handling errors in the application. These components can inherit from `ErrorComponent` and extend its functionality as needed.

## Conclusion

The Foundational Pattern helps build components that can be reused, making the application maintainable and scalable, avoiding multiple points of adjustment and code duplication.
