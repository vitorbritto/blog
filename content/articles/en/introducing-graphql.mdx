GraphQL is a query language, much like SQL, with a single difference - it is geared towards graphs. When I mention graphs, I'm referring to the Data Structure. The purpose of GraphQL is to perform read and write operations through communication between the Front-end and Back-end, similar to the Restful pattern.

GraphQL is agnostic, both on the Front-end and Back-end. Therefore, we can use any programming language. It allows clients to request only the necessary data, making it easy to obtain accurate data and reducing the amount of unnecessary data that may be returned. GraphQL is also highly scalable, flexible and easy to use, enabling developers to create reliable and efficient APIs for their applications.

### What problems does GraphQL solve?

GraphQL addresses several issues in modern web applications, such as:

1. Overfetching: when clients receive more data than they need, consuming more bandwidth and increasing page load times.
2. Underfetching: when clients don't receive enough data in a single request, forcing them to make multiple requests to obtain the necessary information.
3. API versioning: when updates are made to the API, it can be challenging to control and manage different API versions.
4. Inflexibility: when clients are restricted to a rigid query model and cannot customize queries according to their specific needs.
5. Performance: when multiple requests need to be made to different endpoints to fetch various data sets, impacting application performance.
6. Documentation: when clients struggle to understand how to use and navigate the API due to a lack of clear and accurate documentation.

GraphQL tackles these issues by allowing clients to request only the data they need in a single request, customizing the query according to their specific needs. Additionally, GraphQL makes it easier to update and manage different API versions, is more flexible, and is efficient in terms of performance. Clear and accurate documentation is also easy to create and maintain in a GraphQL API.

### What costs does GraphQL bring?

1. Learning curve: Since GraphQL is a relatively new technology, it may take time for developers to learn how to use it effectively.
2. Complexity: The process of defining and modeling GraphQL queries can be more complex than with other API technologies (e.g., REST).
3. Caching: Browsers are already familiar with caching, using a Cache-control of 5 seconds in the Request Header. However, with a single route in GraphQL, determining caching can be challenging.
4. Errors: All calls return a Status Code of 200, meaning they always appear successful. Therefore, it is necessary to model responses in the Schema using a Union to handle errors.

Now let's understand some core concepts of the language.

### Schema Definition Language

GraphQL has its own type system that's used to define the schema of an API. The syntax for writing schemas is called Schema Definition Language (SDL). It's similar to the GraphQL query language itself, but it defines the schema of your data and capabilities rather than querying data.

GraphQL schema is a collection of types that define the shape of your data. It is a contract between the client and the server that defines how the client can access the data.

### Scalar Types

GraphQL comes with a set of default scalar types out of the box:

- Int: A signed 32-bit integer
- Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value
- String: A UTF-8 character sequence
- Boolean: true or false
- ID (serialized as a String): A unique identifier that's often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache.

### Object Types

The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types, which just represent a kind of object you can fetch from your service, and what fields it has. In the GraphQL schema language, we might represent it like this:

```graphql
type Person {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

### Inputs, Enums, Unions and Interfaces

Input, Enum, Union, and Interface types are special types used to define various aspects of the GraphQL schema, providing a way to express different kinds of data and relationships between them.

#### Input Types

- Input types are used to represent complex input parameters for GraphQL mutations or query variables.
- They are similar to regular object types but are used for accepting data, not for returning data.

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  username: String!
  password: String!
  email: String!
}
```

Here, CreateUserInput is an input type that could be used as an argument in a mutation to create a new user.

#### Enum Types

- Enum types define a set of named values for a field, providing a predefined list of possible values.

```graphql
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  USER
  MODERATOR
}
```

The UserRole enum type defines three possible values: ADMIN, USER, and MODERATOR. Fields can then use this enum type to restrict input values.

#### Union Types

- Union types represent a type that could be one of several types. It's a way to express that a field could return different types of objects.

```graphql
union SearchResult = User | Post | Comment
```

Here, SearchResult is a union type that can represent objects of type User, Post, or Comment. This is useful when a field could return different kinds of objects.

#### Interface Types

- Interface types define a set of fields that must be implemented by any object type that implements the interface.
- Interfaces are a way to define common fields for different types.

```graphql
interface Entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
type User implements Entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
type Product implements Entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Float!
}
```

Here, Entity is an interface with common fields id and name. Both User and Product types implement this interface, ensuring they have the required fields.

These special types in GraphQL provide a way to model data more precisely and expressively. When used together, these types contribute to the clarity and flexibility of a GraphQL schema.

### Fields definitions

Basic definitions

- A field can return a list containing items of a particular type. You indicate list fields with square brackets []
- By default, any field in your schema returns null. You can require that a particular field doesn't return null with an exclamation mark !.
- If ! appears inside a square brackets (e.g. [User!]), the returned list can't include items that are null.
- If ! appears outside the square brackets (e.g. [User]!), the list itself can't be null.
- In any case (e.g. [User!]!), it's valid for a list field to return an empty list.

The`__typename`field
In GraphQL, the \_\_typename field is a reserved meta-field that provides information about the type of the object currently being queried. It is often used for introspection purposes, allowing clients to dynamically understand the type of the data they are receiving. This can be especially useful when dealing with polymorphic types or when the client needs to make decisions based on the type of an object.

Consider the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    __typename
    id
    name
  }
}
```

In this query, the user field returns an object that might represent different types of users (e.g., AdminUser, CommonUser). The \_\_typename field is used to retrieve the type name of the returned object. The response might look like this:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "__typename": "CommonUser",
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }}
```

In this example, the \_\_typename field indicates that the user object is of type CommonUser. Clients can use this information for conditional rendering, logging, or making further queries based on the type of the returned object.

It's important to note that`__typename`is not required in every query, and its usage depends on the specific needs of the client application. It's a tool for introspection and can be particularly useful when dealing with GraphQL interfaces and unions where the exact type of the returned object may vary.Arguments
In GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches. You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately.

```graphql
type Query {
  person(id: ID!): Person
}
```

#### Fragments

Fragments allow clients to reuse sets of fields in multiple places within a query.

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  name
}
{
  user(id: 1) {
    ...UserInfo
  }
  anotherUser: user(id: 2) {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

The UserInfo fragment is reused for both user fields.

#### Directives

Directives are used to conditionally include or exclude fields or fragments based on certain conditions.

```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    posts @include(if: $includePosts) {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the @include directive is used to conditionally include the posts field based on the value of the variable $includePosts.

### GraphQL Operations

GraphQL operation is a query, mutation, or subscription that returns data from the GraphQL server. It can be a query for a single object, a query for a list of objects, or any other type of query.

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for queries, mutations and subscriptions. You can think of them as the starting point of every GraphQL operation.

```graphql
type Query {
  listUsers(): [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, age: Int!): User!
}

type Subscription {  userCreated: User }
```

#### Query

GraphQL query is a query that returns data from the GraphQL server. It can be a query for a single object, a query for a list of objects, or any other type of query.

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      id
      title
      content
      attachments {
        id
        filename
        url
      }
    }
    role
  }
}
```

#### Mutation

GraphQL mutation is a mutation that modifies data on the GraphQL server. It can be a mutation that creates an object, a mutation that updates an object, or any other type of mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "John Doe", email: "john@doe.com" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

#### Subscription

GraphQL subscription is a subscription that returns data from the GraphQL server. It can be a subscription for a single object, a subscription for a list of objects, or any other type of subscription.

```graphql
subscription {
  userCreated {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

#### Resolvers

GraphQL resolver is a function that resolves a GraphQL operation. It can be a function that resolves a query, a function that resolves a mutation, or any other type of function.

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      return db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: args.id } });
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      return db.user.create({
        data: { name: args.input.name, email: args.input.email },
      });
    },
  },
  Subscription: {
    userCreated: {
      subscribe: (parent, args, context, info) => {
        return pubsub.asyncIterator("USER_CREATED");
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### Context

In the context of GraphQL, the term “context” usually refers to the context object that can be passed through the execution of a GraphQL query. The context object is a way to share and manage state or data between the resolver functions during the execution of a query.

The context parameter is typically an object that can contain any data or functionality that needs to be shared across resolvers.

```graphql
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      # Access context data
      const { userId } = context;
      # Fetch and return user data based on userId
      return fetchUserData(userId);
    }
  }};
```

In this example, the user resolver function receives the context parameter, allowing it to access the userId stored in the context object.

#### Use Cases for Context

- Authentication: Storing information about the authenticated user (e.g., user ID, roles) in the context to be accessed by various resolvers.
- Authorization: Passing information about the user's permissions or roles to make authorization decisions within resolver functions.
- Data Fetching: Sharing instances of data loaders, database connections, or other resources to be used by multiple resolvers.
- Request-Specific Information: Including request-specific information (e.g., request headers, IP address) in the context for logging or other purposes.

#### Error handling

Error handling in GraphQL involves managing and communicating errors that may occur during the execution of a GraphQL operation, such as a query or mutation. GraphQL provides a structured and standardized way to handle errors and return meaningful error responses to clients.

#### Error Format

In GraphQL, errors are represented as objects with specific fields. The standard structure of a GraphQL error object includes at least the following fields:

- message: A human-readable description of the error.
- locations: An array of locations in the source GraphQL query where the error occurred.
- path: An array describing the path of the field in the response where the error occurred.

```js
{  "errors": [    {      "message": "User not found",      "locations": [{ "line": 4, "column": 7 }],      "path": ["user", "profile", "name"]    }  ],  "data": null}
```

#### Execution Errors

Execution errors occur when resolving a field, validating arguments, or processing directives. These errors are included in the errors array in the response.

```js
# The existing user fields are: id, name and email.query {  user(id: "123") {    name    age # This field might cause an execution error  }}
```

#### Handling Multiple Errors

If multiple errors occur during the execution of a query, each error is included in the errors array.

```js
{  "errors": [    {       "message": "Field 'age' must not have a selection since type 'String' has no subfields.",      "locations": […]    },    {      "message": "User not found",      "locations": […],      "path": ["user", "profile", "name"]    }  ],  "data": null}
```

#### Custom Errors and Extensions

Developers can include additional information in error responses using the extensions field. This is useful for providing custom error codes, logging information, or any other metadata.

```js
{  "errors": [    {      "message": "Invalid input",      "locations": […],      "path": ["createUser"],      "extensions": {        "code": "INVALID_INPUT",        "timestamp": "2022–01–01T12:34:56Z"      }    }  ],  "data": null}
```

#### Handling Validation Errors

Validation errors occur when the GraphQL query or mutation doesn't conform to the schema. These errors are typically returned before the execution phase.

```js
{  "errors": [    {      "message": "Cannot query field 'usernmae' on type 'User'. Did you mean 'username'?",      "locations": […]    }  ],  "data": null}
```

#### Status Codes

GraphQL responses typically have a status code of 200 OK even if there are errors. To distinguish between successful and erroneous responses, clients can check the presence of the errors field.

If using HTTP, additional HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) can be used for more granular error categorization.

#### Handling Authentication and Authorization Errors

Authentication and authorization errors can be communicated through the errors array with specific error messages.

```js
{  "errors": [    {       "message": "Authentication failed. Please log in.",      "locations": […]    }  ],  "data": null}
```

#### Custom Error Handling in Resolvers

In resolver functions, developers can throw errors to signal issues during data fetching. These errors are then captured and included in the GraphQL response.

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (_, { id }) => {
      const user = fetchUserById(id);
      if (!user) {
        throw new Error("User not found");
      }
      return user;
    },
  },
};
```

GraphQL's error handling provides a standardized way to communicate issues during the execution of a query. By including detailed error information in the response, clients can understand and respond to errors effectively. Additionally, GraphQL allows for flexibility in extending error objects with custom metadata, making error responses more informative for both clients and developers.
