title: React Design Patterns: Custom Hooks Pattern
excerpt: A cleaner, more reusable, and easier to maintain code.
---

React hooks, especially when paired with functional components, have brought about a revolutionary change in how we work with common React functionalities like props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle methods. While using the standard hooks is satisfactory, the real game-changer comes with the introduction of custom hooks. Imagine you've crafted a piece of logic for one component using basic hooks like useEffect and useState. Later on, you find the need to reuse that logic in a new component. While copying and pasting might seem like the straightforward solution, employing custom hooks for the same purpose is not only more enjoyable but also offers several advantages. By encapsulating frequently used logic in a custom hook, your code becomes cleaner, more reusable, and, of course, easier to maintain.

## The before and after

Let's start with an example of fetching data from an API without using a custom hook and then refactor it using a custom hook.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const DataFetchingWithoutCustomHook = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"
        );
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data: {data.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetchingWithoutCustomHook;
```

And then, how to encapsulate this logic in a custom hook:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
// Custom Hook for Data Fetching
const useDataFetching = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
};

const DataFetchingWithCustomHook = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useDataFetching(
    "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"
  );

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data: {data.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetchingWithCustomHook;
```

## Conclusion

The custom hook pattern in React proves to be a powerful and elegant solution for encapsulating and reusing logic across components. By extracting common functionalities into custom hooks, developers can enhance code organization, maintainability, and reusability. In the provided example, the custom hook for data fetching streamlines the component logic, making it more focused and easier to comprehend. This pattern aligns with React's philosophy of composability, enabling developers to build modular and maintainable codebases while promoting the efficient reuse of logic throughout their applications. Overall, the custom hook pattern contributes to a more streamlined and modular development experience in React.
