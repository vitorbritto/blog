title: React Design Patterns: Render Props Pattern
excerpt: Dealing with cross-cutting concerns by sharing stateful logic between components
---

As per React's official documentation, Render Prop refers to a technique that involves passing a function as a prop to a component, allowing the component to render content based on the logic provided by that function.

In the Render Props design pattern, a component is structured to accept a function that produces a React Element as one of its props. Rather than relying on its own fixed rendering logic, the component invokes this provided function to determine what content to display.

This approach allows for more flexibility as it avoids embedding specific rendering instructions within each component, offering a dynamic and customizable way to determine how the content should be presented.

### Getting into theÂ context

To understand this better, imagine we have a collection of products that should be displayed in multiple locations of our application.

While the user interface may vary across these sections, the underlying process remains consistent: fetching the products from the API and presenting the list on the screen.

### Hands-on

Let's create a simple example using the Render Props pattern to display a collection of products in different locations of our application.

First, let's declare a list of products:

```js
const products = [  {    id: 1,    title: 'Product 1',    description: 'This is product 1',  },  {    id: 2,    title: 'Product 2',    description: 'This is product 2',  },  {    id: 3,    title: 'Product 3',    description: 'This is product 3',  },  // ...];
```

Then, let's create a Products component that uses the render props pattern:

```js
const Products = ({ render }) => {  // Fetching products can be done here.  return <>{render(products)}</>;};
```

In the Products component, render is a function prop that will be used to render the products. This function will be provided when the Products component is used, allowing you to customize the rendering of the products.

For example, you can use the Products component in two different locations in your application and display the products in different ways:

```js
const HomePage = () => {  return (    <div>      <h1>Products List</h1>      <Products        render={products => (          <ul>            {products?.map(product => (              <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>            ))}          </ul>        )}      />    </div>  );}export default HomePageconst ProductsSection = () => {  return (    <div>      <h1>Products List</h1>      <Products        render={products => (          <div>            {products?.map(product => (              <div key={product.id}>                <h2>{product.title}</h2>                <p>{product.description}</p>              </div>            ))}          </div>        )}      />    </div>  );}export default ProductsSection
```

In this example, in the first usage of the Products component, the products are displayed as a list of titles. In the second usage, the products are displayed with their titles and descriptions.

This approach allows you to reuse the Products component and customize its rendering according to your needs in different parts of your application.

Some popular libraries that use the Render Props pattern include: React Router, Formik, Downshift.

### Conclusion

The Render Props pattern in React is a powerful and flexible design approach that enhances component reusability and composability.

By passing a function as a prop to a component, developers can delegate control over the rendering logic to the parent component, enabling a more dynamic and customizable behavior.
