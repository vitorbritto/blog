title: React Design Patterns: Conditional Rendering Pattern
excerpt: Dynamically control what is displayed to the user
---

Conditional rendering in React refers to the practice of rendering different content or components based on certain conditions. This allows you to dynamically control what is displayed to the user in response to various situations or changes in your application state. There are several ways to implement conditional rendering in React, and one common pattern is using JavaScript's conditional statements within your JSX.

This is undoubtedly one of the most basic and widely used patterns with React components. Typically conditional rendering is achieved using either the && operator or the ternary operator.

```js
{
  condition && <span>Rendered when truthy</span>;
}
{
  condition ? (
    <span>Rendered when truthy</span>
  ) : (
    <span>Rendered when falsy</span>
  );
}
```

In some cases, we might also consider using if, switch, or object literals.

In my React Projects, if I have more then two options, like a multiple variations, I'd prefer to use object literals.

**Why?**

It's more elegant and ease to maintain.

**Check this example:**

```js
import React from "react";
const variations = {
  variation1: <p>This is variation 1.</p>,
  variation2: <p>This is variation 2.</p>,
  default: <p>This is the default variation.</p>,
};

const MyComponent = ({ variation }) => {
  // Use the variation prop to dynamically select the content
  const content = variations[variation] ?? variations["default"];
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Conditional Rendering Example</h2>
      {content}
    </div>
  );
};

// Example usage
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MyComponent variation="variation1" />
      <MyComponent variation="variation2" />
      <MyComponent variation="unknownVariation" />
    </>
  );
};
```

Or, you can handle the entire component like this:

```js
import React from "react";
const authSteps = {
  email: <AuthEmailStep />,
  otp: <AuthOTPStep />,
  pin: <AuthPINStep />,
  biometrics: <AuthBiometricsStep />,
  default: <AuthEmailStep />,
};

// AuthEmailStep.tsx
const AuthEmailStep = () => {
  return (
    // code goes here...
  );
};

// AuthOTPStep.tsx
const AuthOTPStep = () => {
  return (
    // code goes here...
  );
};

// AuthPINStep.tsx
const AuthPINStep = () => {
  return (
    // code goes here...
  );
};

// AuthBiometricsStep.tsx
const AuthBiometricsStep = () => {
  return (
    // code goes here...
  );
};

// AuthContainer.tsx
const AuthContainer = () => {
  // Let's assume that we're using a Custom Hook to fetch the data from
  // some service in Back-end and that service returns the OTP step.
  const { step } = useAuthStep();
  // authComponent will be the AuthOTPStep component.
  const authComponent = authSteps[step] ?? authSteps["default"];
  return <>{authComponent}</>;
};
```

### Conclusion

This pattern is especially useful when you have multiple variations and want to keep your code clean and maintainable. It allows you to easily add or modify variations without cluttering your component with a lot of conditional statements.
