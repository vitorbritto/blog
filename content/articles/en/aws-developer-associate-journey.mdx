In this series, I'll share my journey with Amazon Web Services over the next months. I plan to learn about new services and revisit ones I've already worked with, documenting my experience along the way.

Join me as I explore the world of AWS and gain new insights into cloud computing to become an AWS Certified Developer Associative.

The motivation
A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and it was a truly transformative experience. One of the main motivations behind revisiting and writing this guide stems from the incredible impact it had on my past projects and the ever-evolving nature of cloud computing.

Setting up and provisioning resources became a breeze with services like EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), which allowed for seamless scalability and reduced infrastructure costs. The flexibility to choose different instance types and pay only for what was utilized was a game-changer.

Moreover, the ability to easily host websites on AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) and serve them through CloudFront CDN (Content Delivery Network) enhanced the performance and ensured reliable global accessibility for my applications. It simplified the deployment process, enabling me to focus on the core functionality of my projects.

AWS constantly introduces new services and keeps improving the existing ones, making it essential to stay updated and expand my knowledge.

Starting the journey
The overview begins by introducing readers to the concept of cloud computing and its rapid growth in recent years. It explains how AWS emerged as a major player in this field, providing a range of services that enable businesses to scale, store data, and run applications on the cloud.

The guide then goes on to explore the various components and services offered by AWS. It covers services such as compute, storage, databases, networking, along with others. Each service is explained in detail, highlighting its purpose, features, and use cases.

How are we going to organize all this content?

Because there are too many services, information, use cases, and practical examples to share with you, i'm gonna separate all of this in chapters. The ideia is to bring not only conceptual data, but also a hands-on.
