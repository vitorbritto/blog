When you check in to a hotel, you are usually greeted by a receptionist.

When you check in to a hotel, you are usually greeted by a receptionist.


The receptionist checks your documents, makes some data entries in their system, and directs you to your room.


If there are too many guests, the hotel might keep multiple receptionists.


Load balancers do a similar job for your application.


It’s a tool that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers.


Also, load balancers keep your system available. If one server goes down, it directs the request to another server.

Imagine going for an interview in a company that’s hiring for different positions — Tech Architect, Engineering Manager, and Software Engineer.


For each position, there’s a different panel.


Now, you don’t want the candidates to check each room to find the correct panel.


This is where a coordinator checks the candidate’s profile and directs them to the correct panel.


For a system, API Gateway is that coordinator.


API Gateways can also perform different functions like authentication, rate limiting, logging, and caching.


Fun fact: Layer 7 Load Balancers can also play the role of API Gateways.

Let’s take our interview example further.


For every position (Arch, Engineering Manager, Software Engineer), there are specific rounds of discussions.


Some rounds are different based on the position but some may be common for all positions (such as the Director Round).


How do you coordinate this for each position?


Backends for Frontends is your BFF in this scenario. It’s a coordinator that takes care of the specific rounds for a particular type of interview.


In system terms, BFF is the component that can take care of different device requirements.


For example, you can have a BFF for Web Apps, a BFF for mobile devices, and another one for external applications.


Ultimately, you can have all 3 of them in the same application stack handling stuff at different levels.
